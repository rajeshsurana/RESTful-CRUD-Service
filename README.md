# RESTful-CRUD-Service
A REST Server that supports CRUD services &amp; A Client that implements a CRUD lifecycle

In this project client and server communicate using HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) and JSON format for request/response body.
Client interface allows professor to create, read, update, delete gradebook entries for given student.
